### Module: 3

<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->
### Date: [02/16/2026]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Finalize the core design for the physical board game prototype
- [ ] Define tile, room, and event mechanisms clearly
- [ ] Organize ideas into a chronological development plan
- [ ] Write out rules and instructions for the game

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Finalized the direction of the project for the physical, tile-based horror board game.
  - Defined the core gameplay loop including tile revealing, room interaction, event resolution and monster movement.
  - Established the use of 8 rooms, some containing traps and other containing event spots inspired by the game *Clue*.
  - Brainstormed event spots that can either be beneficial or harmful, such as summoning a ghost that temporarily restrains a player (like the jail card in *Monopoly*) or granting a short term safe effect.
  - Outlined monster behavior using sight range and noise tokens to determine movemnt and targeting.
  - Created a chronological to-do list to guide future development of the physical prototype.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Balancing randomness with player agency, especially when even spots can significantly impact gameplay.
  - Preventing scenarios where players could win too early if the exit tile is revealed in the first few turns.
  - Translating digital horror concepts (like sound and AI behavior) into clear physical mechanics.
    
- **Solutions**:
  - Added conditional win requirements so the exit tile alone is not enough to win.
  - Used simple, readable systems (noise tokens, sight range) to govern monster behavior instead of complex AI logic.
  - Framed events as situational changes rather than pure punishment to maintain engagement.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored:
- Physical board games rely heavily on clarity and consistensy in rules to maintain tension.
- Horror can be created through uncertainty, limited information and pacing, not just combat.
- A strong turn structure helps anchor experimental mechanics like random events and traps.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  - Event spots could evolve based on previous triggers, becoming more dangerous as the game progresses.
  - Monster behavior could escalate over time, increasing sight range or movement speed to heighten late game tension.
  - Exploring how different room layouts could subtly influence player decision-making without explicit instructions.
  - Organizing instructions in a way that's clear and easy to read. Currently researching this.
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "How does limited information increase player tension in a physical board game?"
  - "What mechanics best translate digital horror into tabletop form?"
  - "Does my current design encourage cooperation or competition between players?"
-->

#### Next Steps
- Create a rough paper prototype with tiles, cards, and tokens.
- Write a first draft of the rulebook, focusing on turn flow and monster behavior
- Refine event cards and trap effects based on playtest feedback.
