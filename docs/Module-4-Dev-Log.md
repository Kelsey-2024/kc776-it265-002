#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Define card types and their exact gameplay functionality
- [ ] Establish a consistent pizel-art color scheme
- [ ] Design the physical board layout using
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Finalized the visual direction of the game as pixel-art inspired by early Pokemon era games, translated into a physical board game aesthetic.
  - Still debating the style of the cards - might be color coded to communicate danger, safety and progression.
  - Defined functionality of all core card types: Event, Trap, Item, and Monster cards.
  - Designing a modular tile based physical board game, cards, and tokens should all visually match the pixel art theme.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Ensuring the pixel art aesthetic remains readable and functional in a physical tabletop format
  - Preventing card effects from becoming too complex or interrupting the core turn flow.
  - Translating digital game visuals into printable board components.
- **Solutions**:
  - Limit the color palette and iconography to reduce visual noise.
  - Designed cards with simple, yet immediate effects that resolve quickly.
  - Structured the board as modular tiles rather than a fixed board to maintain replayability.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - Strong visual themes improve player comprehension and immersion in physical games.
  - Color coding is essential for fast decision-making during tense moments.
  - Pixel-art works well for board games when paired with bold outlines and high contrast.

#### Free Thinking
 Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  - The board could visually resemble a top-down RPG interior, with rooms connected by narrow hallways.
  - Pixel shadows and limited lighting could be represented physically using darker tile borders.
  - Cards could include small sprite-style icons instead of text-heavy descriptions.
  - Event cards could evolve over time, becoming more dangerous as the monster grows stronger.

- Example prompts:
  - "How can visual style reinforce gameplay mechanics?"
  - "What physical constraints help simulate digital horror?"
  - "How much randomness is too much for cooperative play?"
  

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session:
  - Create printable prototypes for tiles, cards, and tokens.
  - Playtest card readability and effect clarity.
  - Refine board layout rules (room size, tile limits).
  - Begin sketching sprite-style icons for cards and rooms.
