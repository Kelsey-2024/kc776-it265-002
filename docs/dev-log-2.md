## Name: Shadow Grid Studios
### Module: 2 Dev Log
### Date: [02/10/2026]

#### Goals for this Module
 [ ] GSolidify the physical board game concept for *Into the Shadows*
 [ ] Define tile-based exploration and room reveal mechanics
 [ ] Brainstorm card systems and environmental hazards, such as traps

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Refined the game concept and officially named the project *Into the Shadows*
  - Defined the game as a tile-based board game where rooms are revealed progressively as players explore, creating tension and danger.
  - began designing the card systems, including event cards, item cards, and potential trap cards.
  - Explored the idea of booby traps as hidden mechanics that activate when players enter certain rooms.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Deciding how much randomness tile reveals and card draws should introduce without making the game feel unfair.
  - Determining whether traps should be frequent or rare to maintain suspense without overwhelming players.
- **Solutions**:
  - Decided that the exit and major objectives will remain locked behind required tasks, preventing early lucky wins.
  - Planned to limit traps to specific room types so players can learn to anticipate danger rather than relying purely on chance.

#### Learnings
- Tile-based exploration with hidden rooms naturally creates suspense and encourages teamwork.
- Card driven systems are effective for adding replayability and narrative tension to a physical board game
- Clear categorization of mechanics (tiles, cards, traps) helps keep the design manageable.

#### Free Thinking
- For digital game: Debating on whether to add sound effects to the game board to add suspense. (Audacity, hio,)
- For digital game: To create sprites, libra sprite, a sprite, inkscape, tabletop 
-  Wondering how the physical design will translate cleanly to a digital Unity prototype later.
- Example prompts:
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  - Should event cards resolve immediately or have lingering effects on the board?
  - How can suspense be created through a board game?
  - How much information should players have about danger before entering a room?
  - Should tiles be fully random or should certain rooms be seeded to control pacing?
  - Which mechanics would need to change when moving from turn-based to real-time?
  

#### Next Steps
- Design a first draft of the tile set, including standard rooms, trap rooms, and objective rooms.
- Create same event, item and trap cards for early playtesting.
- Define a simple rule set for trap activation and resolution.
- Begin rough visual mockups of tiles and cards for the physical prototype.
