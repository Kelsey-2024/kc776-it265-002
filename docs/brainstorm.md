## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*

> Initial project concept is a cooperative horror board-style game where players explore a haunted environment by revealing tiles, solving puzzles, and avoiding a monster governed by sight range and noise tokens.
> The monster follows rule-based movement: it chases visibile players, investigates noise created by loud actions, and patrols when no stimuli exist.
> The exit is locked until players complete objectives such as collecting keys and restoring power, preventing early lucky wins and encouraging full exploration.
> This physical prototype will later translate directly into a Unity multiplayer experience with AI-driven enemies and real-time movement.
